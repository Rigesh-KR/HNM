        listed in clause 5 above for us.
      </p>
      <p class="hnm-privacy-terms__txt">7.The purposes listed in the above clauses may continue to apply even in

        our rights under any contract with you).</p>

        your request to be processed and for us to notify you of the consequences of us acceding to the same, including
        any legal consequences which may affect your rights and liabilities to us. In general, we shall seek to process

      <h3 class="hnm-privacy-terms__sub">Protection of Personal Data</h3>
      <p class="hnm-privacy-terms__txt">15.To safeguard your personal data from unauthorised access, collection, use,
        disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks, we have introduced appropriate administrative,
        physical and technical measures such as up-to-date antivirus protection, encryption and the use of privacy
        filters to secure all storage and transmission of personal data by us, and disclosing personal data both
        internally and to our authorised third party service providers and agents only on a need-to-know basis.
      </p>
      <p class="hnm-privacy-terms__txt">16.You should be aware, however, that no method of transmission over the
        Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. While security cannot be guaranteed, we strive to
        protect the security of your information and are constantly reviewing and enhancing our information security
        measures.

      <h3 class="hnm-privacy-terms__sub">Accuracy of Personal Data</h3>
      <p class="hnm-privacy-terms__txt">17.We generally rely on personal data provided by you (or your authorised
